associativity
	Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.Associativity is not the same as commutativity, which addresses whether or not the order of two operands changes the result
commutative
	In mathematics, a binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result
existential_quantifification
	there is at least one
distributive
	If `x*(y+z) == (x*y) + (x*z)`
idempotence
	the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. Specifically, x ∧ x = x and x ∨ x = x for all x.
truth-preserving
	When all inputs are true, the output is true. The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of disjunction.
false-preserving
	When all inputs are false, the output is false.The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false' as a result of disjunction.

linearity
	Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the truth-value of the operation or it never makes a difference.

Negation, Logical biconditional, exclusive or, tautology, and contradiction are linear functions.

there_exists is `∃`
universal_quantifier is `'∀'` or `FOR ALL`
